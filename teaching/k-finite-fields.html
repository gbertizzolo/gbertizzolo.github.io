  <h1 style="margin-bottom: 1%;">K-theory of finite fields</h1>
 
  <p> <b> This page is under construction.</b></p> <hr>

  <p> Summer Semester 2024, Regensburg. Dates and program to be announced soon. Together with <a href="https://graptismath.net">George Raptis</a>. <br> 
    If there is a request, and the speakers agree, the seminar can be streamed on zoom.</p>
  <p>
    The goal of this seminar is to study Quillen's computation of the algebraic K-theory of finite fields. 
    This makes use of various topological and algebraic tools from homological algebra, simplicial homotopy theory, topological K-theory and group cohomology.
    These tools will be reviewed in as much detail as possible and depending on the audience's prior knowledge. <br>
    Basic background knowledge of algebraic topology and homological algebra will be assumed. 
    While no prior knowledge of algebraic K-theory or group cohomology is required, some basic familiarity with these areas, 
    perhaps gained from courses in the recent winter semester, would be desirable. </p>
